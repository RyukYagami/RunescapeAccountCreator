## Dependencies
Dependencies are in the "libs" folder. These are necessary for the jar to be compiled. This uses Anti-Captcha (http://getcaptchasolution.com/espcjise9v) to solve captchas. Please register an account to get an API key.

## How to use?
Double click the .jar file you can download from the release section (Or build it yourself).
Logger is now included in the program, but if you want to be 100% sure to receive logs, please run the program from the command line.
To do this, open cmd/terminal, and type ```java -jar path/to/file.jar```. Program will log to the newest logger instance.
